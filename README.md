### Oficialnie zadanie

**Diskopeia**

Design a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) application
equipped with a TUI (Text User Interface) library to provide an disk
visualization for Unix-based systems. This application draws
inspiration from tools like the disk utility ncdu. Users can
seamlessly navigate through their disk structure, gaining insights
into each folder's key information, statistics, and attributes
directly from the dashboard. Users can simply delete folder or file to
get back space on their disks.


## Development process

Here, the process how we work is described. It's described on the way
of a one portion of a work to implement the product.

### Ticket

One portion of a work to implement the product. In this project there
are two kinds of tickets:

#### Bug

severity = how often does the user flows into it * how severe it is


#### Issue

- one task/idea, unit of work

### The flow

Next we have established following flow for tickets.
Each step in the flow is represented by.

#### 1. Open

No label is needed here. It's just in project's backlog. Here goes
everything first: bug, simple idea, big idea, ...

The tickets here are ready for activity called groomming or refinement
in scrum. That basicaly means that we should sit together and aggree
on: how it will look like when implemented, heppy flow, error
handling, requirements, non funcitonal requirements, design, and
things I don't have currently on top of my head.

Here the ticket is:
- taken down as a idea.

#### 2. Ready for taking

After refinement ticket is ready to develop it. Anyone could pick it
and start coding.

Here the ticket is:
- well described,
- agreed by whole team on the ticket's outcome.

#### 3. In progress

That's quite clear.

Here the ticket is:
- in the making,
- occupied by a developer.

#### 4. Ready for review

Note that the ticket can be taken back to In progress if further
progress is needed. It also does not have to be putten back.

Here the ticket is:
- in review,
- waiting to be reviewed.

#### 5. Closed

Here the ticket is:
- implemented,
- merged to main.


### Working with GitLab

- Create branch named feature/your-feature-name for each task.
- Create branch named fix/your-bug-name for each task.
- Use conventional commits.
